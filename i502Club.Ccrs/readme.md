# i502Club.Ccrs
This is a .net class libray project to support WA's CCRS cannabis reporting system for use 
within other .net applications.  The project simplifies creating the boilerplate 
code for common models, interfaces and enums which developers are likely to 
be working with when sending data to the Cannabis Central Reporting System(CCRS).

It is designed/organized so it can be used with the well known [CsvHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper) library which enables 
efficient generation of the files expected by CCRS in WA State. You may find other creative 
usages for it as well.

Example output using test data:

This project is NON OFFICIAL and has not yet been validated for use in a production 
environment.  It is currently being developed and issues are expected to arise requiring 
fixes.

## Getting Started
To get started you must make a reference to the library from your project by 
adding this repository's github packages nuget feed as a source to your solution 
or cloning the repo and compiling your own version.

To access the package add https://nuget.pkg.github.com/i502Club/index.json as 
a NuGet package source to Visual Studio or any other development tool.

Once you've added the nuget source you can install the package using the 
nuget command found on the package version you're installing(usually latest). 


For most applications it will be the case that you will also want a NuGet 
package reference to CsvHelper.  CCRS is a csv file based system.

The models are intended to work well with CsvHelper to make the file generation process fast 
and easy.  It means the model properties are all in the right order so your CCRS files 
should generate properly by CsvHelper in terms of column placement.

There is great documentation for [CsvHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) if you need a quick primer on working with it.

This repository includes a test project which has tests demonstrating the generation 
of a few CCRS files.  The tests show the steps one can use to create and then read 
from a CCRS file using CsvHelper. It also includes some helper funcs and 
custom converters can be useful for jump starting an app.

### About the Install
You can use the nuget package feed to make upgrading easier but it's not 
required.  You may also clone the repo or download and manually extract the library 
from the package.

### Development
This project will likely see breaking changes.  Please implement accordingly.

There is a known issue in CCRS related to duplicate inventory type names 
(waste and marijuana mixes) in categories.  This project contains an experimental  
Enumeration Class for Product.InventoryType which attempts to address this but it 
is experimental and use may require refactoring once a standardized solution has been 
released to integrators. 

There are seperate Enums representing the category specific inventory 
types available which also avoids duplicate Enum Key name collisions 
that would otherwise occur if using a single Enum. It creates difficulties 
in standard db approaches but workarounds can be used with these Enums 
and depending on your application requirements may be useful.

*Congratulations*! i502Club.Ccrs is ready to go and you should proceed with creating 
something cool for WA canna.  This files generated by this code base have not yet 
been validated and all information pertaining to CCRS must come directly from the WSLCB 
or their [online resources](https://lcb.wa.gov/ccrs/resources).

### Dependencies

 * net frameworks (i502Club.Ccrs)
 * CsvHelper (i502Club.Ccrs.Tests)

## History
This project is used by i502 Club systems for generating in house test CCRS files 
but it has NOT been vetted against the actual CCRS system. When validation 
testing proceeds remaining issues that require attention will get addressed.
