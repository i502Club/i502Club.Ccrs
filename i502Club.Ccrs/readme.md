# i502Club.Ccrs
This is a .net class libray project to support WA's CCRS cannabis 
reporting system for use within other .net applications.  The project 
tries to simplify creating the boilerplate code for common models, 
interfaces and enums for sending data to the Cannabis Central 
Reporting System(CCRS).

It is designed/organized so it can be used with the well known 
[CsvHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper) library which 
enables efficient generation of the files expected by CCRS in WA 
State. 

Example output using test data:

This project is NON OFFICIAL and has not yet been validated for use in a production 
environment.  It is currently being developed and issues are expected to arise requiring 
fixes.

## Getting Started
To get started you must clone the repo to a working directory and begin 
compiling your own version.

For most applications it will be the case that you will also want a NuGet 
package reference to CsvHelper.  CCRS is a csv file based system.

The models are intended to work well with CsvHelper to make the file generation process fast 
and easy.  It means the model properties are all in the right order so your CCRS files 
should generate properly by CsvHelper in terms of column placement.

There is great documentation for [CsvHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) 
if you need a quick primer on working with it.

This repository includes a test project which demonstrates the generation 
of CCRS files.  The tests show the steps one can use to create and then read 
from a CCRS file using CsvHelper. It also includes some helper funcs and 
custom converters which are useful for some of the common basic steps that are 
likely to arise.

### About the Install
You may also clone the repo or download the source zip available 
on the release page.

### Development
This project will likely see breaking changes.  Please implement accordingly.

There was a known issue in v1 related to duplicate inventory type names 
(waste and marijuana mixes) in categories.  This project contains an 
Enumeration Class for Product.InventoryType which attempted to address this 
Enum difficulty. It was left in v2 but may be deprecated at any point which  
would require refactoring for those using the enumeration class properties.

There are also seperate InventoryType Enums representing the category 
specific inventory types available which have been deprecated and will be removed.

*Congratulations*! i502Club.Ccrs is ready to go and you should proceed with creating 
something cool for WA canna.  This files generated by this code base have not yet 
been validated and all information pertaining to CCRS must come directly from the WSLCB 
or their [online resources](https://lcb.wa.gov/ccrs/resources).

### Dependencies

 * net frameworks (i502Club.Ccrs)
 * CsvHelper (i502Club.Ccrs.Tests)

## History
This project is used by i502 Club systems for generating in house test CCRS files 
but it has NOT been tested against the actual CCRS system. When validation 
testing proceeds remaining issues that require attention will get addressed.
